*Generate some shitty "limericks" where each line is a tweet.*

Like [this](http://pentametron.com/) and [this](http://bit.ly/11q0H8S) but
[limericks](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Limerick_(poetry)).

The code is written in Python using [Tornado](http://www.tornadoweb.org/)
and built on top of [postgres](http://www.postgresql.org).

The scraper is in `scraper.py` and the web app is (surprisingly) in
`webapp.py`.
